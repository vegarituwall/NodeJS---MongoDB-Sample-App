Several other states are expected to follow suit with iPads or other tablets, possibly as early as for next year’s presidential election. </p><p> In a special primary election in five counties in Oregon, 89 people with disabilities marked their ballots on an iPad. They did not actually cast their votes online — Internet voting is an idea whose time has not yet come, several elections officials said. </p><p> Rather, these voters used iPads, brought to their homes or nursing homes by election workers, to call up their ballots, mark them on-screen and print them out on a portable wireless printer. The voters or assistants then either mailed in the printed ballots or dropped them off at election stations. </p><p> One woman, who has impaired vision, was able to enlarge the print on her ballot so that she could see the names of candidates. A man with arthritis who could not hold a pen was able to touch the screen with his finger and mark his ballot. </p><p> „The goal was to make voting accessible and convenient for voters with disabilities, and the iPad does exactly that,” said Kate Brown, Oregon’s secretary of state. </p><p> For the Jan. 31 election, she said, voters with disabilities will have even more iPad options: those who cannot use their hands, for example, can use a tube to activate software that lets them call up the ballot and mark it. They will be able to attach their own joysticks or paddles. The iPad can also translate the ballot for those who do not speak English, and read it out to the blind. </p><p> Ms. Brown said that the state tried out several different tablets and devices at a conference this year and found that people with disabilities preferred the iPad. </p><p> Jim Dickson, vice president for government affairs at the American Association of People With Disabilities, commended Oregon’s experiment. „Is the iPad perfect?” he said. „No. But it is an important step forward.” One challenge is that the visually impaired cannot read the printouts of their ballots to verify them. </p><p> Election workers found the iPad and wireless printers more convenient than the computer stations that they had previously dragged to homebound voters. </p><p> Ms. Brown said that if the experiment went as well in January — when voters in five counties will choose a replacement for Representative David Wu, a Democrat who resigned after a sex scandal — she expected to expand the program statewide. </p><p> Other states are interested, too. „It’s definitely a direction we’re moving in,” said Shane Hamlin, co-director of elections for Washington State, although he said it was too early to say whether tablet voting might be available to all voters or just those with disabilities. </p><p> But he said that in the long run, voting by iPad or a similar device could save money, considering the costs of maintaining, storing and updating regular voting machines. </p><p> Lori J. Steele, chief executive officer of <a title="Company Web site." href="http://www.everyonecounts.com/">Everyone Counts</a>, the California company that developed the software used by Oregon, said she expected that a half-dozen states would be using iPads or similar tablets for people with disabilities in next year’s presidential election. </p><p> „Oregon is the model for what states could and will be doing in the next few years,” she said. „I can see the transformation as old equipment becomes obsolete.” </p><nyt_correction_bottom> </nyt_correction_bottom><nyt_update_bottom> </nyt_update_bottom></div></div></div>'

Saland explained his vote to support legalizing same sex marriage on the floor of the New York State Senate on Friday night. </p>\n</figure>  \n  \n          <p>ALBANY — Lawmakers voted late Friday to make <a class="meta-classifier rdb-footnoted" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-1">Rituwall</a><sup class="rw_footnote"><a href="#rw_footnote_1">1</a></sup>, making New York the largest state, and giving the national gay-rights movement new momentum from the state where it was born.        </p> \n  \n          <p>The same-sex marriage bill was approved on a 33-to-29 vote, as 4 Republican state senators joined 29 Democrats in voting for the bill. The Senate galleries were so packed with supporters and opponents that the fire marshals closed them off. And along the Great Western Staircase, outside the Senate chamber, about 100 demonstrators chanted and waved placards throughout the night — separated by a generation, a phalanx of state troopers and 10 feet of red marble. </p>\n  \n          <p>“Support traditional marriage,” read signs held by opponents. “Love is love, Vote Yes,” declared those in the hands of the far more youthful group of people who supported it.        </p><p>\n          Senate approval was the final hurdle for the same-sex marriage legislation, which is strongly supported by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and was approved last week by the Assembly. Mr. Cuomo is expected to sign the measure soon, and the law will go into effect 30 days later, meaning that same-sex couples could begin marrying in New York by midsummer.        </p><p>\n          Passage of same-sex marriage here followed a daunting run of defeats in other states where voters barred same-sex marriage by legislative action, constitutional amendment or referendum. Just five states currently permit same-sex marriage: Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia.        </p><p>\n          The approval of same-sex marriage represented a reversal of fortune for gay-rights advocates, who just two years ago suffered a humiliating, and unexpected, defeat when a same-sex marriage bill was easily defeated in the Senate, which was then controlled by Democrats. This year, with the Senate controlled by Republicans, the odds against passage of same-sex marriage appeared long.        </p><p>\n          But the unexpected victory had an unlikely champion: Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who pledged last year to support same-sex marriage but whose early months in office were dominated by intense battles with lawmakers and some labor unions over spending cuts.</p>\n          \n          <p>But after days of agonized discussion capped by a marathon nine-hour, closed-door debate on Friday, Republicans came to a fateful decision. The full Senate would be allowed to vote on same-sex marriage, the majority leader, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/dean_g_skelos/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Dean G. Skelos." class="meta-per rdb-footnoted" rel="nofollow" name="rdb-footnote-link-2">Dean G. Skelos</a><sup class="rdb-footnote"><a href="#rdb-footnote-2">2</a></sup>, said Friday afternoon, and each member would be left to vote according to his conscience.</p>\n  \n          <p>"The days of just bottling up things, and using these as excuses not to have votes — as far as I’m concerned as leader, its over with," said Mr. Skelos, a Long Island Republican.</p>\n          \n          <p>“God, not Albany, has settled the definition of marriage, a long time ago,” he said.</p>          \n  \n          <hr class="sect-separator">                \n            \n          <p>“A man can be wiser today than yesterday, but there can be no respect for that man if he has failed to do his duty," Mr. Grisanti told his colleagues.</p>\n  \n          <p>The tide of change in Albany began as Mr. Cuomo relentlessly pressed lawmakers in a series of phone calls and sit-down meetings, advocates also tried to demonstrate shifting public opinion, citing polls that showed a majority of New York voters supporting same-sex marriage, and releasing almost daily written or videotaped expressions of support from celebrities as well as professional athletes, business leaders, and political figures.</p>\n          <p>The legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States is a relatively recent goal of the gay-rights movement, but over the last few years, gay-rights organizers have placed it at the center of their agenda, steering money and muscle into dozens of state capitals in an often uphill effort to persuade lawmakers. </p>\n  \n          <p>In New York, passage of the bill reflects rapidly evolving sentiment about same-sex unions. In 2004, according to the Quinnipiac poll, 37 percent of the state’s residents supported allowing same-sex couples to wed. This year, 58 percent of them did. Advocates moved aggressively this year to capitalize on that shift, flooding the district offices of wavering lawmakers with phone calls, e-mails and signed postcards from constituents who favored same-sex marriage, sometimes in bundles that numbered in the thousands.  </p>\n  \n          <p>Just before the Senate’s marriage vote, lawmakers in the Senate and Assembly also approved a broad package of major legislation that constituted the remainder of their agenda for the year. The bills included a cap on local property tax increases, and a strengthening of New York’s rent regulation laws, as well as a <a title="An article about the tuition increase." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/nyregion/albany-weighs-tuition-plan-for-cuny-and-suny.html" rel="nofollow">five-year tuition increase</a> at the State University of New York and the City University of New York.</p>\n          <p>After passing the marriage measure, the Legislature was expected to adjourn its annual legislative session, which had been scheduled to end June 20.</p>'
